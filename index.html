            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <h5>Our platform lets you upload satellite images and automatically calculates how much tree cover is in a specific area. But this tool is more than just about analyzing data—it’s about environmental justice. Tree coverage is linked to things like air quality, temperature control, and access to green spaces—resources that aren’t always equally available to everyone. By identifying areas with low greenery, we want to highlight these disparities and help guide efforts toward more balanced urban planning, reforestation, and climate resilience.

                Our mission is to create a cleaner, healthier planet where everyone, no matter where they live, has access to green space and clean air. Every image we analyze brings us one step closer to building a future that prioritizes sustainability and environmental awareness. Together, we can drive change and make sure our cities and communities become more inclusive, eco-friendly, and supportive of everyone’s well-being.
                
                By combining technology with environmental science, we’re working to make it easier for people, organizations, and decision-makers to identify areas that need more natural resources. Whether you’re a city planner, an environmental advocate, or just someone who cares about the planet, this tool is a way to see the problem clearly and take action for a greener, more sustainable future.</h5>
